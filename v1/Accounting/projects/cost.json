      "lang": null,
      "content": "The rent expense of $5,000 is a fixed cost, while the raw material cost of $10 per unit is a variable cost. The total cost is calculated as follows: Fixed Cost = $5,000; Variable Cost = 500 * $10 = $5,000; Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Cost = $5,000 + $5,000 = $10,000."
